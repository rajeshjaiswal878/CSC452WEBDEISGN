<h4> Play Start here........</h4></br>
[Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian, Francisco]
<h4>GONZALO</h4>
      [To ALONSO]</br>
       <div class="tooltip">By'r lakin, <span class="tooltiptext">a mild form of the oath "by our Lady"</span></div>
       I can go no further, sir;My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed</br>
       Through <div class="tooltip">forth-rights and meanders!<span class="tooltiptext">straight paths and winding ways</span></div> By your patience,
       I needs must rest me.

<h4>ALONSO</h4>
       Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
      Who am myself <div class="tooltip">attach'd<span class="tooltiptext">Seized</span></div> with weariness,</br>
      To the <div class="tooltip">dulling<span class="tooltiptext">Exhaustion</span></div> of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
      <div class="tooltip">Even<span class="tooltiptext">Right</span></div> </br>
     here I will put off my hope and keep <div class="tooltip">it<span class="tooltiptext">i.e. Hope</span></div>
     No longer for my <div class="tooltip">flatterer:<span class="tooltiptext"> Deceiver</span></div> he is drown'd
       Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks</br>
    Our <div class="tooltip">frustrate<span class="tooltiptext">Useless (stress the first syllable)</span></div> search on land. Well, let him go.</br>

<h4>ANTONIO</h4>
       [Aside to SEBASTIAN]</br>
       I am right glad that he's so out of hope.
    Do not, for one <div class="tooltip">repulse<span class="tooltiptext"> Setback</span></div>, forego the purpose
       That you resolved to effect.

<h4>SEBASTIAN</h4>
       [Aside to ANTONIO]</br>
       The next advantage Will we take throughly.

<h4>ANTONIO</h4>
       [Aside to SEBASTIAN]</br>
       Let it be to-night;
     For, <div class="tooltip">now they are oppress'd with travail<span class="tooltiptext">Now that they are fatigued with their efforts</span></div>, they
       Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
       As when they are fresh.

<h4>SEBASTIAN</h4>
       [Aside to ANTONIO]
       I say, to-night: no more.
       Solemn and strange music.

<h4>ALONSO</h4>
       What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
</br>
<h4>GONZALO</h4>
       Marvellous sweet music!
</p>
<p>
[Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes,
 bringing in a banquet;they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation;
 and, inviting the King and company to eat, they depart]
</p>

<p>
<h4>ALONSO</h4>
     Give us kind <div class="tooltip">keepers<span class="tooltiptext">guardian angels</span></div>, heavens! What were these?

<h4>SEBASTIAN</h4>
     A <div class="tooltip">living drollery<span class="tooltiptext">Live entertainment</span></div>. Now I will believe
       That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
       There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
       At this hour reigning there.

<h4>ANTONIO</h4>
       I'll believe both;
     And <div class="tooltip">what does else want credit<span class="tooltiptext">Anything else that's believable</span></div>, come to me,
    And I'll be sworn 'tis true:</br>
    <div class="tooltip">travellers ne'er did lie<span class="tooltiptext">Travellers√≠ tales are considered notoriously false</span></div>,
       Though fools at home condemn 'em.

<h4>GONZALO</h4>
       If in Naples
       I should report this now, would they believe me?
       If I should say, I saw such islanders--
    For,</br>
    <div class="tooltip">certes<span class="tooltiptext"> Certainly</span></div>, these are people of the island--
       Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,</br>
    Their manners are more <div class="tooltip">gentle-kind<span class="tooltiptext"> Well-bred</span></div> than of
       Our human generation you shall find
       Many, nay, almost any

<h4>PROSPERO</h4>
       [Aside] Honest lord,
       Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
       Are worse than devils.
